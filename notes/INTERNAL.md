# Internal Development Notes

## Personal Todos
- [ ] Implement new feature X
- [ ] Fix bug Y reported by Alice
- [ ] Optimize function Z

## Design Decisions
- Used library A for feature X for better performance
- Chose algorithm B because of its low complexity

## Issues to Investigate
- Memory leak in function X
- Inconsistent behavior in module Y

## Code Smells
- Function X is too long, consider breaking it down
- Module Y could benefit from caching

## Ideas
- Add caching layer to improve speed
- Investigate library C for future use

## Research Notes
- Paper A suggests algorithm B could be useful for feature X
- Blog post C has a useful discussion on optimizations for Y

## Testing Notes
- Test A is flaky when run in parallel
- Test B requires environment variable C to be set

## Temporary Workarounds
- Hardcoded value in function X
- Skipped tests in module Y

## Checklists
### Pre-release
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Merge develop into main

## Review Notes
- Feature X needs additional tests
- Module Y could use more comments
